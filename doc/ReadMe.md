To make a Tetris game using only free and open source libraries and the C programming language, you could use the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library for graphics and input, and the GLib library for data structures and utility functions.

## Steps
[ ] - Install the SDL and GLib libraries on your development machine
[ ] - Use SDL to create a window for the game and handle user input (keyboard and/or gamepad)
[ ] - Use GLib's data structures (such as linked lists or arrays) to store and manipulate the game's data (i.e. the Tetris pieces and their positions)
[ ] - Use SDL to render the game's graphics, including the Tetris pieces, the playing field, and any other visual elements (such as the score or level)
[ ] - Implement the game logic for Tetris, including creating and moving the Tetris pieces, detecting and handling collisions, and keeping track of the score and level
[ ] - Test and debug your game, making any necessary adjustments or improvements.
