# Tetris C, SDL, and OpenGL
## What is this?
- This a recreation of the popular game Tetris. 
- The core functionality is all written in C and SDL2.
- For better performance and graphics, OpenGL is used instead of SDL2's renderer (but still with the option to use SDL's).
## Why make this?
- Tetris is one of my favorite games.
- I don't want much from it but many current options don't have I want what basic features I do desire (namely a Zen/endless mode at a static speed).
- A desire to combine the creativity of game development with the benefits and challenges of low-level optimization, the C programming language, and further my own technical abilities. 
- Going forward as a freelance developer, I want to have projects I'm proud of and demo what I'm capable of.
## Why SDL2 and OpenGL over a dedicated game engine? 
- I like pushing myself, and having a background in embedded development, I wanted to still feel close to the hardware.
